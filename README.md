# Mcity-AV-Challenge

## Introduction
To simplify the environment setup and ensure consistency in the developing and testing environments, we primarily utilize Docker Images to handle simulated testing environments and communication for developing and testing AV decision-making modules. This repository contains the configuration files about how to set up the Docker containers for the Mcity AV Challenge. In addition, we provide some useful information for the AV decision-making module, including the Mcity high-definition map in the SUMO network format and a sample route to follow. We also provide a simple example of how to develop and test the AV decision-making modules.

## Installation
Please install the Docker Desktop following [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) first. Then, you can pull the Docker image from the Docker Hub by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up -d
```
